## Crowdfunding Platforms Excel Analysis

Crowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter and Indiegogo have been growing in success and popularity since the late 2000s. From independent content creators to famous celebrities, more and more people are using crowdfunding to launch new products and generate buzz, but not every project has found success.

Project Overview
To receive funding, a project must meet or exceed its initial goal. Many organizations dedicate considerable resources to analyzing old projects to discover “the trick” to success. This challenge involves organizing and analyzing a database of 1,000 sample projects to uncover hidden trends.

Analysis Tasks

Data Preparation and Initial Analysis
1. Conditional Formatting
Apply conditional formatting to the Outcome column to visually distinguish between successful, failed, canceled, and live campaigns.
2. New Calculated Columns
Percent Funded: Calculate the percentage of the funding goal achieved by each campaign.
Average Donation: Calculate the average donation per backer for each campaign.
Parent Category and Sub-Category: Split the Category and Sub-Category column into two separate columns.
3. Date Conversion
Date Created Conversion: Convert Unix timestamps in the launched_at column to Excel date format.
Date Ended Conversion: Convert Unix timestamps in the deadline column to Excel date format.

Pivot Tables and Charts

4. Outcome Analysis by Category
Create a pivot table to count the number of successful, failed, canceled, and live campaigns per category.
Generate a stacked-column pivot chart that can be filtered by country.
5. Outcome Analysis by Sub-Category
Create a pivot table to count the number of successful, failed, canceled, and live campaigns per sub-category.
Generate a stacked-column pivot chart that can be filtered by country and parent category.
6. Outcome Analysis by Date
Create a pivot table with Outcome as columns, Date Created Conversion as rows, and count of Outcome as values.
Add filters for parent category and years.
Generate a pivot-chart line graph to visualize this table.

Crowdfunding Goal Analysis

7. Goal Range Analysis
Create a sheet with the following columns: Goal, Number Successful, Number Failed, Number Canceled, Total Projects, Percentage Successful, Percentage Failed, Percentage Canceled.
Populate the Goal column with specified ranges.
Use the COUNTIFS() formula to fill in the counts for each outcome.
Calculate the total projects and percentages for each goal range.
Generate a line chart showing the relationship between goal amount and success rates.

Statistical Analysis

8. Backer Analysis
Create a summary statistics table for the number of backers of successful and unsuccessful campaigns.
Evaluate the mean, median, minimum, maximum, variance, and standard deviation for both successful and unsuccessful campaigns.
Analyze whether the mean or median better summarizes the data and compare the variability between successful and unsuccessful campaigns.

Conclusions

Key Insights
1. Category Performance
Theater, film, and music have high success rates despite having many projects. Journalism, though fewer in number, has a 100% success rate.
2. Sub-Category Trends
Plays have the highest number of successful projects, with significant failures and cancellations. Live projects in plays, animation, and video games are noteworthy.
3. Seasonal Trends
More successful projects are launched in June and July, with a notable drop in August and a steady decline in colder months.

Summary Statistics Interpretation

The median better summarizes the data due to outliers.
Higher variability in successful campaigns is expected due to a wider range of backer numbers.
